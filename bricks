we want to make a row of bricks that is goal inches long . we have a number of small bricks(1 inch each) and big bricks(5 inch each).
return true if it is possible to make the goal by choosing from the given bricks



#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int small,big,goal;
printf(" enter the values:");
scanf("%d%d%d",&small,&big,&goal);
if(goal>small+big*5)
{
    printf("false");
}
else if(goal/5<=small)
{
    printf("true");
}
else
{
    printf("false");
}
return 0;
}
