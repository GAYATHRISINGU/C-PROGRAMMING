scenario based question:
we are having a part with amount of a tea and candy return the int outcome of the party encoded as 0=bad, 1=good, 2=great.
A party is good (1).if both tea and candy are at least double the amount of the other one the party is great(2) however
in all if either tea or candy is less than 5. the party is bad(0)

#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
int tea,candy;
printf(" enter the no of tea:");
scanf("%d",&tea);
printf("enter the no of candy:");
scanf("%d",&candy);
if(tea<5||candy<5)
{
    printf("0");
}
else if(tea>=2*candy||candy>=2*tea)
{
    printf("2");
}
else if(tea>=5&&candy>=5)
{
    printf("1");
}
return 0;
}
