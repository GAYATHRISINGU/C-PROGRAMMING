scenario based question: 
When squirrels get together for a party, they like to have cigars. A squirrel party is 
successful when the number of cigars is between 40 and 60, inclusive. Unless it is the 
weekend, in which case there is no upper bound on the number of cigars. Return true if 
the party with the given values is successful, or false otherwise. 
cigarParty(30, false) → false 
cigarParty(50, false) → true 
cigarParty(70, true) → true

PROGRAM:
#include<stdio.h>
void main()
{

    int cigars,weekend;
    printf("enter the value of cigars:");
    scanf("%d",&cigars);
    printf("enter 1 for weekend \t 0 for not weekend");
    scanf("%d",&weekend);
    if(weekend==1)
    {
        if(cigars>=40)
        {
            printf("true");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("false");
        }
    }
    else  
    {
        if(cigars>=40&&cigars<=60)
        {
            printf("true");
        }
        else
        {
            printf("false");
        }
        
    }
